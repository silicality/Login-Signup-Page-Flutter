Welcome • Login • Signup Page (Flutter) – Community Edition

This repository is a community-driven extension of a Flutter-based Welcome, Login, and Signup UI project.
It is designed as a real-world practice project where contributors can upgrade a basic authentication UI into a more complete, production-ready solution.

📌 Project Origin & Credit

This project is forked from the original work by Abuanwar.

Original Repository: https://github.com/abuanwar072/Welcome-Login-Signup-Page-Flutter

Original Author: Abuanwar

Purpose of the original project:
A clean and minimal Flutter UI for Welcome, Login, and Signup screens.

Backend integration

Security best practices

This makes the project ideal for learning, contribution, and real engineering challenges.
